# Kaspersky Lab Test Task
The project was completed as part of a test task for Kaspersky Lab. The layout has been prepared according to the [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/5y299fXwsvG264LfnuKB3e/kaspersky-test-task?type=design&node-id=12659%3A40171&t=uxWxC3f7lq6MFIO4-1). 
## Launch

## Notes
Standards for styling interactive elements are not represented in the mockup. I've added styling to these elements based on the color scheme of the mockup.
